# Even More Cursed DIVA
![Main Game Screenshot](readme_img/Screenshot_MainGame.png)

A Project DIVA ripoff written in C++ and using OpenGL 1.4 with ARB extensions. In reality, more of a sort of game engine thing written with compatibility with Windows XP-era integrated GPUs in mind. Maybe someday it will use something more modern, like OpenGL 4.3 or Direct3D 11.

I probably should point out that this project tries to imitate the gameplay from main console games (PSP/DT games and F series), not Arcade-based ones (Future Tone and Mega Mix).

## Why you shouldn't think too much about this thing
I could probably say something about how this is a valuable learning experience for me, but honestly, even disregarding diehard C++ fans who complain about others for not writing code the same way as they do, I'm generally surprised that this thing can even compile and run. A lot of this code has been written in C# style since this is another language I'm familiar with the most, and I'm not really familiar with features of modern C++ (like smart pointers), so don't be surprised to find almost non-existing code structure, memory leaks, small "utility" functions which generate `std::vector`s, and other glaring issues that would make Yandere Simulator's source code look better in comparison.

Initially, I didn't plan on making this repository public, but I didn't want to spend even more time constantly rewriting this project from scratch again instead of simply refactoring it. Letting it just sit here also doesn't seem really good, especially if *somebody* ~~(bro though he was cooking with this oneðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)~~ would want to hack around with this code, but whatever.

A lot of this code was just me playing around with random ideas and also trying to implement gameplay from some random rhythm game about singing robots with dead eyes/dancing dolls with overly glossy skin (choose whichever you like the most).
